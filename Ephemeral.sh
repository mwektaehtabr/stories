sections=("One week of dating and then a terminal diagnosis. Afterward a breeze is blowing in from the lake and light pink blossoms are floating down from the cherry trees along the path. Struck by the sight, they stand motionless together, watching petals flutter to the ground.\n\n\"Jay,\" she says.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he says.\n\n\"I have to tell you something embarrassing,\" she says.\n\nShe keeps staring straight ahead without looking at him.\n\n\"It's so beautiful my heart is pounding,\" she says.\n\nThe clouds are tinted indigo. Mist glistens on budding leaves. Breathing in, he can smell wet grass, damp earth. A chickadee chirps by a puddle, then pecks at the shimmering water. Goldfinches flit across the path. So many blossoms have fallen onto the path that what's usually just dirt and pebbles is now a radiant promenade almost entirely covered in petals. The petals that have landed in puddles are a darker shade of color, submerged under rippling reflections of the sky. He can feel the chill of the breeze on his face and the moist cling of the socks on his feet, soaked through his sneakers by a puddle much deeper than expected further back on the path. Pebbles grind under the soles of his sneakers as he shifts his stance, glancing back over at her. Her eyebrows are furrowed together, and she's pressing the tip of her tongue into the narrow gap between her front teeth with her jaw jutting out and her lips slightly parted, which he's noticed before means that she's concentrating.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" he says.\n\n\"I'm trying to memorize the moment,\" she says.\n\nLooking at her at this angle, he can see the glimmering outline of the silicone contacts in her eyes. She's focusing so intently that her shoulders have gone slack and her chin has sunk to her chest and her hands hang limp from the cuffs of her denim jacket. She's enraptured. The black nail polish on her fingernails is chipped on some fingers, and skin peeks through rips in the knees of her jeans, and mud is spattered across the leather toes of her boots, and daylight gleams on the ring hanging from her septum. The corner of her mouth is crusted with a blotch of dried ketchup from breakfast at the diner. Becoming aware of the aftertaste of maple syrup on his tongue, he sucks at the lingering sweetness, a smoky flavor, like charred sugar, and then he turns back to the cherry trees. A powerful gust of wind rushes across the path, and a storm of petals flurries to the ground, and he realizes suddenly that by tomorrow all of the blossoms will probably have already fallen.\n\nHe becomes aware again of the brochure from the hospital clenched in his fist.\n\nShe's nineteen. He's twenty. She could have tried to prolong whatever remains of her life. She doesn't want to spend whatever remains of her life drugged up on pharmaceuticals. Anyway she's never had insurance.\n\nBeyond the cherry trees, swans are drifting along the river.\n\n\"You want to move in?\" he says." "Rooting together through the trash in the dumpster, they discover a sack of passionfruit.\n\n\"I've never found passionfruit doing this before,\" he says.\n\n\"I've never even tasted a passionfruit before,\" she says.\n\nAfter cutting through the plastic with his knife, he reaches into the sack, palming a passionfruit. The bright purple rind of the passionfruit is wrinkled and firm but feels mushy when squeezed, and when he raises the passionfruit to his nose to sniff the rind, the passionfruit has an aroma so ripe that his nostrils flare. He holds out the passionfruit for her to smell, and then he digs his fingers into the passionfruit, splitting the rind, exposing the vibrant yellow pulp. He hands the passionfruit to her, and she hesitates for a moment, staring down at the passionfruit, and then she bends her head and parts her lips and sticks her tongue deep into the rind, curling her tongue up to scoop the pulp into her mouth. Her eyes widen and then crinkle as she registers the tart burst of flavor, and then she grunts in surprise at the crunch of the seeds in her teeth, chewing. A spurt of juice drips from the corner of her mouth as she swallows. Dipping her head, she knuckles the juice from her chin, laughing.\n\n\"These are intense,\" she says.\n\nSitting there on the pavement, they eat through the sack of passionfruit together, slurping up pulp, munching on seeds, licking drops of juice from the piths, until finally every last passionfruit is gone, the rinds tossed back into the dumpster. His mouth tingles from the tang of the juice. His fingers feel sticky. Seagulls cry out, coasting through the sky above the supermarket. A snail with a whorled shell is crawling along the curb, trailed by a glittering streak of slime. In the woods beyond the parking lot, the birch trees sway with a breeze as ferns ripple in the shade below. Moss is growing on a rotting stump. The weather is balmy. Initially she seemed nervous about scavenging, even somewhat afraid, but she looks comfortable now, leaning back against the dumpster in a ripped t-shirt and stonewashed jeans with her elbows on her knees, squinting into the dazzling sunlight. Breathing in, he can smell a whiff of her perfume on the air, a rosy scent. A loose strand of hair hangs from her bun. Spots of motor oil are spattered across the canvas on her sneakers. Nearby, iridescence is shimmering in a puddle of grease. Hearing a shopping cart clatter across the parking lot toward the supermarket, he glances down at the tote bag by his boots, already brimming with scavenged food. A bent can of tomatoes, an expired carton of rice, some oranges, dried figs, a jar of marmalade smeared with honey.\n\n\"What happens if somebody catches us back here?\" she says.\n\n\"I usually just smile and say sorry and then walk away,\" he says.\n\nNia frowns, looking disappointed, and then reaches up to scratch the back of her neck.\n\n\"I was hoping maybe we'd have to run,\" she says." "After she's finished buzzing his hair, she switches off the trimmer, drifting behind him. Gnats are hovering around the streetlamps, glittering. Crickets chirp at the twilight. Sticks are still scattered across the sidewalk from the windstorm earlier that afternoon. The cars parked along the curb are tinted by a gritty dusting of pollen. Pollen is crusted around the iron bolts on the fire hydrant. Pollen is clumped in the rubber treads on the tire swing. Catkins are dangling from the branches of the cottonwood trees across the street. Sitting there in the driveway in his boxers on the stepping stool from the kitchen with a ragged bath towel draped over his shoulders, he feels her hand moving through his hair, briskly rubbing his head, and then her fingers brushing the rims of his ears, and then a puff of air as she blows at the back of his neck, wiping away flecks of hair with her thumb. The warmth radiating from the rough concrete slabs of the driveway only moments before has vanished in the dusk. Breathing in, he can smell charcoal burning nearby. Freshly fertilized grass. The briny fragrance of her lotion. From somewhere nearby, a faint scent of marijuana. Some ragweed has sprouted in the yard. He's thirsty. Licking his lips, he can taste salt on his mouth from the fries. The truffle oil. The fatty grease. Beyond his feet, pollen is rippled across the driveway. Dirty footprints are worn into the soles of the flip-flops she kicked off into the grass. Her cup is still lying over on the stoop from that morning. A breeze drifts across the yard, and the catkins flutter on the cottonwood trees, and the ivy rustles on the garage. The air feels mild. Up the road, on the lawn of a colorful bungalow in the distance, water glimmers on a newspaper in a transparent cyan bag, probably from a sprinkler. Becoming aware of the tingling itch in his thigh, he reaches for the mosquito bite, digging his fingernails into his skin as he scratches, feeling a rush of pleasure initially, then eventually just a throbbing pain, and he lowers his hand again, and the sensation in his thigh fades to an ache. He can hear a pendulum clock chiming the hour in an apartment back in the house.\n\nNia steps around the stool to look at him, gripping the trimmer, wearing a sweater over mesh shorts with the thick black curls of her hair pinned back in the claws of a tortoiseshell clip. The tip of her nose is sunburned a bright shade of crimson. Her knees are scraped from tripping on the pier. Her feet are dusty. He suddenly remembers her telling him about her grandparents crossing the border.\n\nResting a hand on her hip with her head tilted to the side, she glances from his hair to his face and then down at his neck and back up at his ears, gazing down at him with a squint.\n\n\"Your hair looks great, but the rest of you still looks terrible,\" she says." "\"I just feel like we never have enough time,\" she says, speaking in a tone of desperation, clinging to him on the mattress from behind.\n\nShe doesn't feel that way because of the diagnosis, she says. She'd feel like that even if she could live for a hundred years, even if she could live for a thousand years.\n\n\"The universe is billions of years old,\" she says.\n\nHe realizes she's crying when he suddenly feels the wet of her tears where her face is pressing against his neck.\n\n\"The human life span is so cruel,\" she says.\n\nThe sunrise is tinting the sky lavender through the window over the dresser. The bright green leaves on the maple trees are fluttering with a breeze. The bedroom is still mostly in shadows, but in the dim light he can see her uniform on the floor and her boots on the floor and the atlas she found at the thrift store, flipped to a map of the peninsula. The incense she lit burned out hours ago, but he can smell the lingering fragrance.\n\nHe has a terminal condition too, he realizes.\n\n\"Did you hear that?\" she says, lifting her head from the mattress, sounding alert.\n\n\"Hear what?\" he says.\n\nShe hushes him. He frowns, listening. Wiping the tears from her face, she twists away from him, and he hears a hand patting around the nightstand as she fumbles for her glasses, and then the mattress dips as she rises from the bed, and he hears her feet padding across the floorboards as she creeps toward the window.\n\nStanding next to the dresser, she peers out.\n\n\"Jay,\" she whispers, motioning for him without looking away from the backyard.\n\nRising from the bed, he steps cautiously over to the window.\n\nIn the whorled nest of dried mud and grass and twigs out on the ledge, a chick is hatching from the jumbled cluster of turquoise eggs. He watches in shock as the chick flops over in the nest, flapping a pair of fleshy wings, struggling to escape the broken halves of the shell.\n\n\"This is so amazing,\" she whispers.\n\nShe grins at him.\n\n\"I was so worried we'd be at work or something when the eggs finally hatched,\" she says.\n\nRaising her hands to grip the frame of the window, she peeks back out at the ledge. He can see a shimmering reflection of the nest in the lenses of her glasses. Naked in the cool morning air, her skin is pimpled with goosebumps. He becomes aware of the pungent odor of her sweat, a vegetal aroma, like fresh celery, wafting from the tufts of hair in her armpits. His mouth is bitter with the aftertaste of her juices, still laced with a trace of blood from her period, and he sucks for a moment at the coppery tang.\n\nWith a flitter of wings, a robin lands on the ledge, cheeping at the chick in the nest, and then bends to peck away the bits of shell.\n\n\"Now aren't you glad we weren't asleep yet?\" she says." "After he's applied the bleach to her hair, she sits out on the stoop with him, waiting for the bleach to set. Butterflies are fluttering around the mailbox. A hummingbird flits through the yard, briefly hovering over the emerald garden hose coiled up in the grass, and then darts off down the road. Across the street, fluffy clumps of seeds are floating down from the cottonwood trees, landing on the sidewalk and in the gutter and in tufts of grass, clustering in the iron grates of the storm drain, clinging to the rubber grooves on the tire swing, bunching in the windshield wipers of the cars parked by the curb. Iridescence glimmers across a puddle of motor oil in the driveway. Some thistles have sprouted by the garage. Beneath his jersey, he can feel drops of sweat trickling from his armpits down his ribs. Ice cubes snap in the glasses of cola. He runs a hand over the buzzed hair on his scalp, feeling the soft velvety texture of the bristles under his fingers. He's hungry. Breathing in, he can smell barbecue grilling nearby. Freshly mowed lawn. From somewhere nearby, a faint scent of watermelon. The fungal odor of her feet. Nia is hunched on the stoop in a bra and jean cutoffs, cross-legged on the rough cement, wearing a plastic shower cap to protect her hair while the bleach is in. Her cheeks are flushed from the heat. A glossy sheen of sweat gleams on her shoulders, down her arms, on her chest, down the rippled flesh of her belly. The soles of her feet are smudged with dirt. Drinking a sip of cola, she puckers her lips and bends her head and spits an ice cube out into the palm of her hand, and then she reaches around to press the ice cube against the back of her neck. Water dribbles from her fingers down her back as the ice cube melts against her skin. Squinting into the dazzling sunlight, she lowers the glass back down to her lap, looking out at the street. Her sandals are still lying in the yard from the night before. Up the road, heat haze is shimmering over the pavement, warping the appearance of the colorful bungalows in the distance. A box fan is humming in an apartment back in the house. Condensation drips from the glass in his hand, wetting his knuckles. He takes a sip of cola, holding some on his tongue for a moment to feel the fizz before swallowing, tasting the bittersweet notes of caramel, herbs, citrus.\n\nNoticing an amber cicada shell clinging to the railing, he suddenly becomes aware of the pulsing drone of the cicadas singing in the heat.\n\nThe cottonwood trees sway with a gust of wind, and fluffy clumps of seeds whirl through the air, flurrying off down the road.\n\nHe can hear the mechanical timer from the kitchen ticking away the seconds next to her on the stoop.\n\n\"Secretly,\" she says, \"I was always excited to get old. I've always wanted to have white hair.\"" "Roaming together through the meadow in the park, they discover a patch of dandelions. The gigantic shadows of the oak trees stretching across the grass only seconds before have vanished in the twilight. Fireflies are twinkling, drifting through the meadow. Frogs chirp at the dusk. The air still feels steamy from the cloudburst earlier that afternoon. Initially she seemed wary of foraging, maybe even apprehensive, but she looks happy now, squatting over the dandelions in cotton shorts and a faded t-shirt with her hands on her knees. After digging into the dirt with his knife, he pulls up a dandelion, palming the roots. The dandelion has a faintly sweet fragrance. Moving his fingers over the dandelion, he touches the jagged tips on the leaves, the soft yellow petals on the flower, the smooth rubbery stem shading to fuchsia, and then he twists the roots from the dandelion, handing the dandelion to her. Bending her head, she sniffs the flower curiously, and then she bites the flower from the stem, grunting at the taste as she munches, pumping her jaw, grinding the flower in her teeth. Tentatively sticking out her tongue, she licks some creamy sap from the tip of the stem before popping the stem into her mouth, and then she stuffs her mouth with the leaves, crinkling her nose with amusement at the bitter smack of flavor. Sitting there together in the meadow, they eat through the dandelions in the patch, nibbling at flowers, gnawing on stems, chewing leaves to a mash before swallowing, until eventually every last dandelion is gone, the roots tossed back to the grass. His tongue tingles from the tang of the leaves. He can feel a salty crust of dried sweat on his arms. His fingers are streaked with dirt.\n\n\"I've never eaten so many dandelions before,\" he says.\n\n\"I never even knew dandelions were edible,\" she says.\n\nSigns are glowing in the windows of the convenience store across the street from the park.\n\n\"A satisfying meal,\" she says.\n\nBreathing in, he can smell a whiff of her deodorant on the air, a jasmine scent. The skin on her arms is suntanned a dark shade of bronze. A loose strand of hair hangs from her bun. He suddenly remembers her telling him about watching her grandparents get deported. Some burrs are stuck to the shoelaces in her sneakers. Nearby, lichen is growing on a fallen twig. Hearing a shopping basket clatter onto the sidewalk by the convenience store, he glances down at the tote bag by his boots, brimming now with foraged provisions. Wild strawberries, clusters of bittercress, bunches of clover, some violets, a cattail flecked with mud. He becomes aware of a throbbing ache in his lip, still swollen from the bumblebee sting, and he sucks on his lip for a moment, trying to ease the pain.\n\n\"Have you ever gotten in trouble doing this?\" she says.\n\n\"Probably nobody even noticed us,\" he says.\n\nNia squints, looking doubtful, and then leans back onto her hands.\n\n\"But would you run if we got caught?\" she says." "She appears in the door of the pizzeria, looking at him with an expression of urgency. She's wearing an apron smudged with powdered cocoa over her uniform from the bakery, and the toes of her sneakers are dusted with flour, and her fingers are caked with wet globs of dough. Her hair hangs from the backward brim of the sunbleached ballcap that she always wears while she's working, a keepsake from kindergarten teeball, the one year her parents let her play. Her eyes look intensely brown in the light.\n\n\"It's time,\" she says.\n\n\"I've gotta go,\" he says, and then he hangs the peel from the rack by the oven, walking out the door.\n\nOut on the street the weather is humid. Dragonflies flit through the air, wings sparkling. A woodpecker raps at the bark on a trunk. A crowd has formed in the road, gazing in silence up at the sky.\n\nNia takes out the eclipse glasses and hands a pair to him.\n\n\"Don't peek,\" she says.\n\n\"I'll try,\" he says.\n\nThe sky is overcast with a murky haze of clouds, and a strong wind is blowing, and the eclipse disappears and then reappears as clouds rush across the sky. Looking up at the eclipse, he can see the dark circle of the moon overlapping with the glowing crescent of the sun, and then the eclipse vanishes behind clouds again. Breathing in, he catches a whiff of chlorine on her skin from sneaking into the pool behind the motel the night before, and then all he can smell is hot tar on the pavement. The eclipse is still hidden by the clouds. She's been so excited for the eclipse she's hardly slept. He feels crushed that now she can't even watch the eclipse at the climactic moment. An aftertaste from the cappuccino is lingering in his mouth, and he sucks at the bittersweet tang, becoming aware that his heart is pounding from the caffeine. Staring up at the clouds, he suddenly remembers watching her make gyokuro for the first time, standing at the peach countertop in the kitchen as she poured water over the tea in the shiboridashi, explaining to him that steeping the tea in such little water would produce a greater concentration of umami, a breathtaking intensity of flavor, and he remembers sipping the tea with her, and then he remembers meeting her for the first time, eating gelato together by the lighthouse, the day she confessed that secretly her lifelong dream had been to become an astronaut, even though she'd always known that was impossible, because she'd always been so terrible at math.\n\nVoices are calling for her from the door of the bakery, while others shout at him from the door to the pizzeria.\n\nThe eclipse becomes visible through a gap in the clouds.\n\nThe moon is now almost perfectly aligned with the sun.\n\nWhen she speaks, she sounds ecstatic.\n\n\"I was mad about the weather at first, but coming in and out of the clouds like that actually makes the eclipse seem more dramatic,\" she says." "\"Ichi-go ichi-e,\" she says, \"is basically this concept, or maybe this awareness, that every experience in life happens only once. That the exact specific conditions of a moment can never be reproduced. Every experience is unique. Even the most everyday mundane repetitive experiences, like tying a shoelace, or washing a dish, are never exactly the same. And so, because of that, for that reason, every experience in life should be savored.\"\n\nShe discovered the idea in some anime or manga.\n\n\"You've been to this beach before, you'll come to this beach again, but this is the only time in your life that you'll sit on the beach in this exact moment,\" she says.\n\nHe becomes aware of the grainy texture of the sand under the soles of his feet, and the feel of the heat from the fire radiating onto his face, and the sensation of his back exposed to the chill in the air, and the smooth curves of the driftwood under his buttocks through the damp fabric of his swimsuit. Waves splash ashore and then surge foaming back into the shallows. The lighthouse gleams in the distance. Raising the charred tip of the stick in his hands, he sucks on the sticky residue of melted marshmallow, and a loon hoots in the darkness, and then a gust of wind rushes across the beach and the flames gutter in the fire and the beachgrass ripples wildly as leaves rustle in the forest beyond the dunes. Breathing in, he can smell the fragrant aroma of the pine trees, and then the wind calms, and he smells the tart scent of the woodsmoke rising from the logs. Firelight glimmers on the ring hanging from her septum where she sits hunched on the driftwood in a hoodie and some leggings with her feet in the sand. The bruise on her cheek has darkened to purple since her wipeout on the skateboard, and her lips are still scabbed where her skin split. Cupped in her hands in her lap she holds the petoskey she found earlier on the beach. The stone looks ordinary, just a plain light gray, now that the stone is dry.\n\nMoonlight shimmers across the vast surface of the lake.\n\nMichigama.\n\nHe suddenly remembers that the lake was formed over thousands of years by a melting glacier.\n\n\"I've always hoped maybe time is circular,\" he says.\n\nShe bends to lick the petoskey, dragging her tongue across the pale surface of the stone, and then she lifts her head, staring down at the honeycomb pattern revealed by her saliva.\n\n\"We'll only experience this moment once in a lifetime. But if what we think of as the beginning and the end of the universe are actually connected, forming an endless loop, then we'll get to live this moment again an infinite number of times, in the eternal return,\" he says.\n\nWood snaps in the fire. Embers glow among the ashes. The honeycomb pattern is already fading as the stone dries.\n\nNia glances at him with a mischievous look.\n\n\"See you next time,\" she says." "\"Pay attention to me,\" she says.\n\nA splash hits his face. Drops of cream drip from his chin down onto the screen of his phone. Startled, he glances up from the screen with a surge of anger, wiping cream from his cheek, and then the feeling fades to a sense of astonishment as he registers that she actually threw a spoonful of cream at him. She's staring at him across the table, gripping the spoon by the handle. He can see the glimmering outline of the contacts in her eyes. A fraying tuft of thread extends from the collar of her oxford where a button is missing. Her sleeves are pushed up onto her forearms. She's still wearing the neon wristband from that concert weeks ago. A loose strand of hair hangs from her bun. Out the windows over the sink, the leaves on the maple trees are gold and scarlet and orange, changing color in the brisk air. Dew glistens on the tips of the leaves. Ducks are flapping through the sky. The kitchen is dim, lit only by the daylight streaming down through the clouds. Breathing in, he can smell the rich scent of coffee on the air, an almost melony aroma, some hints of pecan, blending with the odors of the potted rosemary and the scallions and the chives and the thyme, the dried serranos strung up from the hook by the oven, the butternut squash ripening on the sill. The musty fragrance of the house. Paint is chipping from the rusty knobs on the cupboards. A blotchy water stain is rippled across the corner of the ceiling. The linoleum is peeling from the floor by the fridge. Glancing over at the counter, he notices the jar brimming with cash next to the toaster, and he suddenly remembers lighting sparklers with her down by the creek, the night that she first told him about lifting money from the register at the bakery, about how she'd realized that if she only pretended to ring up an item then she could create a surplus of cash in the drawer so that her boss would never even know that cash was missing. She's been working full-time for minimum wage ever since she moved out of home. She was barely older than a toddler when she realized that her parents had never wanted her. That her parents only thought of her as a nuisance. As a burden. She hasn't told her parents about what's happening. She already knows her parents wouldn't actually care. Her parents didn't even bother to show at her graduation. Sounding almost ashamed, she recently admitted that she's never had a birthday party. He becomes aware of the scar in her eyebrow. A pale strip of skin. Her mouth tightens as she blinks.\n\n\"You're so distant sometimes,\" she says.\n\nNia stares at him with a look of bitterness, maybe even resentment, furrowing her eyebrows with her nostrils flared and her jaw clenched, and then she turns away from him, slipping the spoon into her mouth, sucking cream from the steel." "After the argument, she slumps back with her lips pinched and her arms folded across her chest, looking away from him with an expression of revulsion. Trembling with rage, he stares down at the feast spread across the table. The day-old croissants she brought home from the bakery, still flaky and buttery enough to make a tongue curl in pleasure. Fresh sage harvested from the dumpster behind an organic grocery, gruyere and comte scavenged from the garbage at the mall, acorns and hickories gathered from the park by the butcher shop, sauteed chanterelles foraged from a thicket behind the bodega. Mismatched mugs brimming with wine, a bottle of cabernet uncorked for a customer at the bakery the week before. He becomes aware of an aftertaste in his mouth from the wine, a vinegary bitterness with an undertone of tart cherries, faintly flavored by the scent of garlic and shallots lingering in the air over the pan on the stove, and the pungent odor of the mold carved from the cheeses, and the savory aroma of the char on the roasted nuts. Out the windows over the sink, a crisp breeze is blowing. Leaves are falling from the maple trees, orange and burgundy and ruby, fluttering down toward the grass. Wisps of fog drift through the branches. Geese honk in the sky. The kitchen is dim, lit only by the daylight streaming down through the clouds. Glancing at the counter, he notices the sauce stains on the towel crumpled next to the blender, and he suddenly remembers watching fireworks with her down by the pond, the night that she first told him about hiding in her closet as a kid whenever her parents were fighting, and how once she was so terrified by the explosions of smashing plates and crashing furniture that she vomited. His phone is glowing on the counter. She's glaring at him across the table.\n\n\"Would we even still be dating if I wasn't sick?\" she says.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he says.\n\nNia grips the edge of the table, leaning in toward him with her elbows cocked out and her face twisted into a sneer.\n\n\"I don't want your pity. If we're only together because you feel sorry for me, I can just go. I should just go,\" she says.\n\nAnd then she pushes away from him, turning toward the sink with a scowl. A loose strand of hair hangs from her bun. The collar of her cardigan has slipped down over her shoulder. He can see the glimmering outline of the contacts in her eyes.\n\n\"I didn't mean we wouldn't be together because of me. I would have wanted to be with you either way. I just didn't know whether you'd have still wanted to be with me,\" he says quietly.\n\nHe's almost too frightened to continue.\n\n\"Would you?\" he says.\n\nShe's biting her thumbnail.\n\n\"Would you still be dating me if you weren't sick?\" he says.\n\nShe stares at him, hesitating, and then glances down at the floor with a look of helplessness.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she says." "At twilight the sound of the rain drumming on the roof finally fades to an eerie silence, and they step out of the house together, staring. Floodwaters are rippling against the steps to the stoop. The neighborhood has been transformed into a shimmering marsh.\n\nWading out into the frigid water, they drag the old canoe out from the junk heap behind the garage, and the canoe dips and sways and then steadies as they climb aboard, floating over the driveway. Lightning is still flickering in the clouds on the horizon, and a crack of thunder occasionally rumbles in the distance, but otherwise the sky is calm. They paddle together down the street, drifting past constellations of glowing windows, looking around in awe. Squirrels swim past the canoe, heading toward a telephone pole. An air mattress floats past the canoe. Some rubber galoshes. A plastic toboggan. Perched on a birdbath, a fox blinks down at the water. Wind chimes tinkle on a nearby porch, and goosebumps rise on the back of his neck as the breeze flurries through his jacket. Rainwater is dripping from the branches of the cottonwood trees. A gigantic beech tree collapsed into the road across from the motel. Soaring out from behind the gas station, a heron glides through the dusk, skimming the surface of the water, and then flaps off toward the diner. Drifting into downtown after nightfall, they paddle together beneath the darkened traffic lights and streetlights looming over the boulevard, past the submerged patios of deserted businesses, through cars abandoned haphazardly in the flood. Bats flit through the air over the canoe. Nia is a silhouette on the seat ahead of him, wearing the baggy windbreaker she found at the thrift store, with her hair heaped into a messy bun. Breathing in, he catches the scent of her shampoo on the air, a citrusy fragrance, like lemon zest. He can feel the chipped paint on the handle of the paddle in his hands and the smooth aluminum of the hull under the soles of his feet and the spiderweb brushing against his shins and the canoe bobbing as floodwater laps against the canoe in the darkness. The sky is clear now. The sky has no moon. Stars are glittering in the water. Glancing up, he can see the milky glimmer of stars at the heart of the galaxy rippling across the sky. He becomes aware of a faintly woody aftertaste in his mouth, from biting the pencil while he was hunched over his notebook back at the apartment, and he sucks at the flavor, running the tip of his tongue over the grooves in his teeth. The climate of the planet is changing so quickly. A meteor streaks through the sky above the canoe in a blaze of tangerine.\n\n\"Nobody is ever going to know we were here,\" she says.\n\nFor a moment he thinks she's talking about him and her, about canoeing together through downtown, and then he realizes that she's looking up at the stars, and that maybe she's talking about the human species." "As sleet pours down through holes in the roof, glazing the floor with gritty ripples of slush, they wander together through the ruins of the library in the hazy blue daylight streaming down through the clouds. The rims of his ears are tingling. His hands feel numb in his jacket. Breathing in, he becomes aware of the scent of mildew in the air. Mushrooms are growing from wet heaps of moldering books. Wind whistles through cracks in the plywood hammered over shattered windows. A ripped tarp hanging over a doorway flutters in the breeze. Somebody squatted in here once, he realizes, or maybe just partied. In the dark nook of space beneath an empty bookcase tipped against the wall, beer cans and tarot cards are scattered across the floor. A rotted sock. Burned newspapers and cinders and charred scraps of cardboard from a fire. Noticing a peppery aftertaste in his mouth from dinner at the cafe, he sucks at the lingering flavor. The meaty cream of kidney beans. The spicy tang of chili powder. Nia is standing under the grimy skylight over by the reference desk with her hands stuffed in the pockets of a baggy trench coat and her hair dangling from the brim of a wool hat. She was the one most excited to come here, but now for some reason she seems profoundly sad. He glances down at the meandering trail of her bootprints in the slush, and then he steps over to the reference desk as she wipes away the sleet on the cover of a dictionary. The white nail polish on her fingernails is chipped on some fingers. The corner of her mouth is swollen with a pimple. Her cheeks are flushed from the cold, but she hasn't buttoned the trench coat, and he can see the necklace on the chest of her turtleneck. The flash drive hanging from a loop of twine that he wore as a necklace when he was a kid. Ever since he told her about being a hacker when he was younger, she's been wearing the necklace everywhere.\n\n\"I know you said never to mention love,\" he says.\n\n\"Don't you dare say another word to me,\" she says.\n\nShe glances at him with a look of warning, and then she steps past him, biting her lip.\n\nJust then, with a clatter of hooves on granite, a massive deer with gargantuan antlers suddenly trots out from behind a bookcase and then freezes in the aisle, staring straight at her.\n\nStartled, she raises her hands and backs away and then slips in the slush on a rusted pipe on the floor, falling backward with her hands flung into the air, and as she hits his chest he catches her under her arms, wrapping his arms around her to support her weight.\n\nSnorting clouds of steam, the deer springs off through the ruins, splashing through icy puddles.\n\nLimp in his arms, still staring straight ahead at the crumbling gap in the wall where the deer vanished, she breathes out.\n\n\"Fuck, that scared me,\" she says." "They sit together in plastic chairs in the dazzling fluorescent light in the laundromat as ice shimmers out in the darkness. The ice glazing the power lines and shop awnings and the soaring branches of the trees along the curb, and the ice rippling across the sidewalk, and the glossy shell of ice on the curving steel beam of the bike rack by the door. Down at the intersection, a traffic light blinks, flashing red over the ice in the road. A neon sign glimmers in the windows of a pub. A pheasant darts across the street, slipping on some ice, wings fluttering for balance, and then vanishes into an alley behind the pharmacy. In the laundromat he can hear the quiet rumbling of the washers and the dryers and occasionally the muffled clatter of a button or a zipper tumbling in a drum. Breathing in, he becomes aware of the scent of detergent. A floral aroma, like blooming tulips. Over by the change machine, a puddle of spilled detergent gleams sapphire on the floor. Colorful laundry whirls against the portholes of the washers and the dryers, some submerged in chambers of sudsy water, some floating through chambers of heated air. Nia looks mesmerized, gazing at the portholes through the smudged lenses of her glasses, pressing the tip of her tongue into the gap between her front teeth. Crystals of ice sparkle in her eyebrows, in the acrylic fibers of her hat. Still freezing from the walk to the laundromat, she's faintly shivering, hunched up with her parka zipped to her throat and her hands balled up in her mittens, resting in her lap. A glistening drip of snot is leaking from her nose. Reaching up without looking away from the portholes, she wipes the mucus from her nostrils, and then she sniffs. Her undereyes are dark pits. Her cheeks have hollowed. Duct tape is wrapped around the toes of her sneakers where the soles were splitting from the canvas. Staring down at the duct tape on her sneakers, he suddenly remembers the pungently sour taste of the duct tape when he was biting off strips for her back in the bedroom, and then randomly he remembers noticing her birthmark for the first time, sitting with her down by the marina as she pointed at the caramel blotch on her thigh, explaining the elaborate mythology she'd invented about the shape, which she'd always imagined looked like a drifting comet.\n\nIce glitters beyond the windows as headlights swing across the parking lot of the laundromat.\n\nStill looking at the portholes, she reaches over to him, grasping his hand. Through the rough wool knit of her mitten he can feel the soft dip of her palm and the sharp lumps of her knuckles and her fingers curling tight around the base of his thumb. The snot that she wiped onto her mitten has already dried. Squeezing her hand, he turns back toward the portholes, the digital timers glowing next to the dials.\n\nHolding hands together, they watch laundry spin as the timers count down." "Snow flurries out in the darkness as they sit together in the pickup in the shimmering neon light in the carwash. With a tremor, the pickup begins drifting into the tunnel on the conveyor. Beyond the windshield, gigantic colorful brushes are whirling and swaying through the air. Wet ribbons of cloth flutter against the windows of the pickup with a patter, and strips of cloth flap across the hood and the windshield and the roof, squishing, and bright teal suds ripple down the windows. Nia looks captivated, lying across the seat with her head resting in his lap, gazing at the windshield through the smudged lenses of her glasses, pressing the tip of her tongue into the gap between her front teeth. Snow glitters in her eyebrows, in the acrylic fibers of her hat. She's faintly shivering, still freezing from the walk to the pickup, hunched up with her parka zipped to her throat and her hands balled up in her mittens, pressed to her chest. Her undereyes are dark hollows. Her cheeks have cratered. The skin around her nostrils is rubbed raw from wiping away snot. Through the polyester stuffing in her parka he can feel the hard lump of her shoulder and the slender dip of her collarbone beneath his hand. The hip of her parka is smeared with a beige blotch of dried mucus from a sneeze. Looking at the mucus, he suddenly remembers the pungently inky taste of the cash he was biting back in the bedroom when she wiped the mucus onto her parka. Packing tape is wrapped around the tips of the shoelaces in her sneakers where the plastic caps were chipping apart, fraying the string. Breathing in, he can smell the scent of gasoline. He turns back toward the windshield, the electric clock glowing in the dashboard. As the pickup approaches the end of the tunnel, water cascades down the windows. Dryers whirr over the roof of the pickup, blasting heated air, and trickles of water stream in every direction, and drops of water tremble before streaking away, and then the windows are clear again. The pickup comes to a halt.\n\nPressing her hands into the leather cushion on the seat, she rises from his lap, dropping her feet to the rubber mat on the floor.\n\nSnow is glimmering under the streetlights beyond the end of the tunnel. The snow heaped on the traffic signs and shop awnings and the branches of the trees drooping over the curb, and the twisting wisps of snow flowing across the sidewalk, and the snow mounded on the curved steel bars of the bench at the bus stop. Down by the intersection, some brake lights flash, glowing red across the snow in the road. An owl swoops down from a power line, gliding off toward the highway, wings beating a powdery trail of snow into the air that briefly sparkles before vanishing. The time ticks up on the clock.\n\nThey stare out the windshield together as a fluorescent sign blinks over the door, instructing the driver to change gears." "He's just sinking into the hot steaming water in the tub when she slips into the bathroom without looking at him, shuffling over to the toilet. Lifting the lid, she drops her sweatpants to her ankles, and then she squats down onto the seat, sitting there hunched in a faded sweatshirt with her elbows on her knees and her chin in her hands, staring straight ahead into the flickering light of the candles glowing on the counter over by the sink. After a moment he hears the splash of her urine hitting the water in the bowl of the toilet, then eventually only a trickle, and then just faint drips. Frost gleams in the window. He swivels back toward the ceiling, lying there in the sloshing warmth of the water with only his head and his knees exposed to the bitter chill of the air drifting in through the drafty old walls of the house.\n\n\"Do you remember what all those handprints are from?\" she says.\n\nHe glances at the handprints in the steam on the mirror.\n\n\"No,\" he says.\n\nNia frowns, pointing.\n\n\"That one is mine, I think, from leaning on the mirror a couple of days ago when we were brushing our teeth before bed. That one is mine too, I think from a couple weeks back, leaning against the mirror while we had that debate about our postures. But that one up there, though, that looks like one of yours. I don't know. Maybe from that time we had sex in here. I remember you kinda fell into the mirror when you came,\" she says.\n\nHe realizes that the steam on the mirror is already fading.\n\nTearing a strip of toilet paper from the roll, she reaches down to wipe between her legs, and then she drops the toilet paper into the bowl, tapping the handle to flush. Water sputters down the plumbing. Yanking her sweatpants back onto her hips as she stands, she flips down the lid of the toilet, and then she looks at him. Candlelight shimmers on the ring hanging from her septum.\n\n\"Promise to me you'll never stop writing,\" she says.\n\n\"I promise,\" he says.\n\n\"But promise you'll never write about me,\" she says.\n\nHe hesitates, thinking.\n\n\"I won't,\" he says.\n\nShadows flutter across her face. Her eyes are vibrantly bloodshot. Her cheeks are looking gaunt. Lately her headaches have seemed nearly constant, and her appetite has been meager, at most just a bite of apple or some crackers with peanut butter. She's gotten so skinny her ribs poke through her skin. The knobs of her hipbones, the ridge of her spine. Yesterday she was reading him poems at the kitchen table. Soon all she'll be is a corpse in a box.\n\n\"There'd be no way to tell the story right anyway,\" he says.\n\nShe stares at him for a moment, pressing the tip of her tongue into the gap between her front teeth, and then she turns away from him. Slapping a handprint into the steam on the mirror, she walks out the door." "Driving past the trailhead, she has an urge to climb to the overlook for the sunset, insisting she's still strong enough, swearing she has enough energy, but after climbing the first slope she feels dizzy, leaning feebly against his shoulder with a hand pressed to her forehead, and from there he has to carry her piggyback with her arms draped around his neck. Even in the shade of the woods the air feels warm. Water drips from melting icicles. Water streams from thawing snowdrifts. Light green leaves are budding on the trees. Bluebirds twitter in the branches. Hiking the trail, he can feel the nylon fabric of her windbreaker crinkling against his shirt where her chest is resting against his back, and the rough denim of her jeans where her thighs are gripped tight in his hands, and the hard rubber on her sneakers knocking against his calves where her feet are dangling, and wisps of her hair fluttering against his ear where her head is tilting to peer past him. Her nose is stuffed, and he can hear her sniffling, and occasionally he can smell a whiff of the chocolate on her breath, and then all he can smell is the fresh scent of the thaw. Sunlight flickers between the trunks of the trees with every step. His boots splash through shimmering puddles of meltwater. A cardinal pecks at a pine cone, then chirps and hops and flits onto a boulder spotted with lichen. A turtle totters over some moss. Nia has become frighteningly skinny, but the trail is steep, and by the time he's reached the summit his arms are aching and his legs are trembling from the strain of resisting gravity. Staggering into the sunlight at the rim of the overlook, he sinks down to his knees and sets her onto the sand and then falls back on his hands, panting.\n\n\"We're just in time,\" she says.\n\nShe gazes out at the view, pressing the tip of her tongue into the gap between her front teeth as her windbreaker rustles in the breeze. Even being carried to the overlook has exhausted her. She's breathless, sitting slumped in the sand with her chest heaving for air. Her lips are tinged faintly blue.\n\nTucking a strand of hair behind her ear, she glances at him.\n\n\"Boy,\" she says, \"why are you crying?\"\n\nHer voice has a tone of concern. Through the watery blur in his eyes, he can see that she's staring at him with a tender expression. Tears streak down his cheeks as he blinks. Reaching over, she wipes the tears from his face with her thumb. Swallowing the lump in his throat, he looks out over the forest and the dunes and the sparkling waters of the lake beyond. The sky is glowing bright magenta, tinting the clouds shades of violet. With a sudden flutter of wings, a flock of starlings ripples past the rim of the overlook in an iridescent shimmer.\n\nShe leans into him, nuzzling her head into his neck.\n\n\"Want to hear something funny?\" she says.")
